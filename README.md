Railway Journey
Overview
Welcome to the Railway Journey! This command-line application is designed to find the best routes between two railway stations within a given network. Leveraging a comprehensive railway network graph, the application calculates possible journeys from an origin to a destination station, taking into account the number of allowed transfers.



Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js
A terminal or command line interface
Installation
Download and install Node.js from nodejs.org.

Clone the repository:

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/railway-journey.git
cd railway-journey
Install dependencies:

sh
Copy code
npm install

1. Setting Up Development Environment
Follow the steps outlined above to set up Node.js and install the necessary dependencies to streamline your development process.

2. Basic Folder Structure
Organize your project with the following folder structure and configuration for efficient development:

app/: Contains the main application logic.
data/: Contains various JSON files representing different railway networks.
src/: Contains the main scripts for running the network analysis.
network.js: Main script to run the network analysis.
railway.js: Core logic for the railway network.
Root Directory:
.gitignore: Git ignore file.
package.json: Node.js project metadata and dependencies.
README.md: Project README file.
3. Usage
To use the Railway Journey Planner, run the following command in your terminal, replacing the placeholders with your specific information:

sh
Copy code
node src/network.js <data/railtrack_file.json> <origin> <destination> <max_transfers>
<data/railtrack_file.json>: Path to the JSON file containing the railway network graph.
<origin>: The name of the origin station.
<destination>: The name of the destination station.
<max_transfers>: The maximum number of transfers allowed for the journey.
Example

sh
Copy code
node src/network.js data/railtrack_uk.json "Edinburgh" "London" 3
This command searches for routes from "Edinburgh" to "London" with a maximum of 3 transfers, using the railway network defined in data/railtrack_uk.json.

4. Project Notes
This is an example of a railway network. A railway network can be built from large data sets of JSON files and then traversed to find the shortest path between two stations. This is one example of a railway system that I built and traversed. One of the many great things I am learning in one simple project in a course. Recursion can get confusing when working with a large dataset and objects have very complex relationships.
